						I'm Andreas, a CS Student at Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta with a passion on software
						engineering, and UI/UX design. I enjoyed the whole process of development because of the
						satisfaction of creatively tackling challenges.

				<p class="font-inter font-light text-sm leading-relaxed">
					I began my journey around mid-2020, when I started freelancing as a mobile developer
					(Android and Flutter). My initial progress wasn't all rainbow and butterflies, but I
					managed to deal with it. Around this time, I also dive into UI/UX Design niche, knowing
					that being a solo developer might need this kind of a skill. Beside of these skills, on my
					free time, I also learned some web development (React, ExpressJS, SQL)!

				<h2 class="font-source font-semibold text-2xl">still on the road... ðŸš€</h2>
				<p class="font-inter font-light text-sm leading-relaxed">
					Right from entering college and up till now, I'm focusing myself on the fundamentals of
					Computer Science and Software Engineering. I spent most of my time exploring algorithm
					design, software architecture and continually practicing myself to create practical design
					for various real-world problem. You might wanna check them out on my project page! And for the
					next couple of years, I'm looking for fascinating opportunities (internship, project
					or partnership), especially in software engineering niche.

					<p class="font-inter font-light text-sm leading-relaxed">
						Out of all, mobile development in Android and multiplatform (Flutter) has been my
						specialty. Since my freelancing era, I realized that the essence of mobile development,
						and basically any software development lays in its architecture, pattern and the way the
						code beautifully synergized. From this discipline, I always thrive to develop every
						project with clean and suitable architecture. Combined with some knowledge of latest
						trends and libraries, I'm able to develop a performant and beautiful mobile application.
						In nutshell, I'm proficient in Flutter and its libraries, Android, and Firebase.

					<p class="font-inter font-light text-sm leading-relaxed">
						In terms of web development, I have quite the experience of developing some fullstack
						web, mostly for my college's events. Just like the mobile development, I always thrive
						to bring clean architecture to every project. Furthermore, I'm proficient in front-end
						frameworks such as React, Next, Svelte, Astro. And for the back-end site, I'm proficient
						in crafting API in ExpressJS, and Golang. While for the database, I'm proficient in SQL,
						MongoDB and Firebase.

					<p class="font-inter font-light text-sm leading-relaxed">
						This niche has been around since my freelancing era. Again, I realized that UI/UX Design
						proficiency is useful for solo-developer like me :3. Related to my passion in software
						engineering, beside my creative touches, I tend to view UI/UX requirements from the
						technical side. While designing interfaces, I favored workflow that features deep
						consideration on the design system, and therefore creates a consistent, clean and
						feasible design for development.
